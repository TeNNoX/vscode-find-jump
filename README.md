> This is a fork (kind of) of https://github.com/msafi/xvsc/tree/master/findJump. Changes between this and the original repo should be reflected in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-find-jump/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.

Find-Jump works when you type a sequence of characters so that it can narrow down the location to where you want to jump.

## How to use Find-Jump

When you activate Find-Jump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>), you'll see a blinking red light in the status bar indicating that Find-Jump is active and is receiving your input (see gif above). Now you can start typing the characters to where you want to jump. Usually 3 to 5 characters should be enough to narrow down the location, but your own workflow may vary.

A few things to note:

* The jump character is always a single letter. Sometimes the jump character needs to be pressed with the SHIFT key, which would be indicated on the jump location like `â‡§z`
* Pressing the arrow keys or the enter key will exit Find-Jump

## Settings

- `findJump.letterBackground`: Background color of the extension's main decoration: letter to jump.
- `findJump.letterBackgroundLight`: Background color of the letter for light themes.
- `findJump.letterForeground`: Color of the extension's main decoration: letter to jump.
- `findJump.letterForegroundLight`: Color of the letter for light themes.
- `findJump.overviewRulerMatchForeground`: Color of the matches in the scrollbar area.

## Commands

- `findJump.activate`: which activates Find-Jump
- `findJump.activateWithSelection`: like `findJump.activate` but will make a selection from the current cursor position to the new cursor position

# TODO (in the future):

- [x] Remove delay (100ms debounce seems excessive and should be nuked)
- [x] Configure colors
- [ ] Option to limit the search in visible area (instead of scanning the entire document)
- [ ] Option to search in all visible editors (split/grid)
- [ ] Command to go to the next/previous match
- [x] Show number of matches in the status bar
- [x] Show matches in the scrollbar
- [ ] Option to render decoraitons on top of the text instead of prepending (that moves the entire text)
- [x] Cancel the mode on <kbd>Esc</kbd> press
- [x] Remove last typed character on <kbd>Backspace</kbd>
- [ ] Go to first match on <kbd>Enter</kbd>
